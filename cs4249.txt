What must students be given?

Should students be provided with the interface?

Format of data output? Enforce CSV, but let them decide the necessary fields/cols and ordering of column,

Code Components:
- Autocomplete library
- Code to show windows
- Code to retrieve text from data files


Setting Up is difficulty. Can do purely static.

Conclusion:
- Use pure JS
- Work in teams
- Code experimental interface

- Students must implement the main bulk of the experiment themselves.
- Students should already have the design. They should create something concrete.

- Students start with empty index.html, for pre and post survey questionnaires.
-

Code Library should have:
- AutoComPaste
- Traditional Copy and Paste


- Design it as a library to conduct autocompaste experiments
- Show a demo
- Tell them need pre and post questionnaire. Either they code themselves or use Google Forms.
